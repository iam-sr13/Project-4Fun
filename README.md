# Project 4Fun

This project consisit of 4 Command Line games, namely:
1) BLOX
2) What's the Day?
3) Guess my number!
4) Let's Matchstick!!

If you want to know more about these games, just CCR (clone, compile and run!!) ;)

Note: This is my first C project made as a part of my high school project (Standard XI)
Ofcourse I didn't knew about github at those fresh years of cs experience... so as a memory I am uploading it now.
I still cherish these first games I made myself as I am a very enthusiastic gamer as well. ;)
